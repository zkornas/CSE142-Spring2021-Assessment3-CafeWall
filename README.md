Take-home Assessment 3: Cafe Wall

## Part A: Doodle
The first part of your assessment is to write a program that uses DrawingPanel to produce an image of your choice. Your program can produce any image you like, with the following restrictions:
- The image should not include hateful, offensive, or otherwise inappropriate images.
- The image must be at least 100×100 pixels and must contain at least three distinct shapes and at least two distinct colors.
- The image must not be substantially similar to your solution for Part B, consist entirely of reused Part B code, or be substantially similar to a related CSE 142 assignments from a previous quarter or any examples from class.
- The code must successfully compile and run, and must not enter an infinite loop.
- The code must not use material beyond Supplement 3G of the textbook.
